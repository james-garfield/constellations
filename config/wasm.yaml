# Shell commands to run before or after building.
# This is more (CMake) style, where you can run shell commands before building. 
# Also, you can run shell commands after building.
# shell:
#     before:

#     after:
#         - app.exe # Usually you want to run the program after building it.
#         - echo "Goodbye, world!"
